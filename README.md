# Alx_DjangoLearningLab

 Project Overview
This repository contains my Django learning lab as part of the **ALX Back-End Web Development** program. The purpose of this project is to practice and understand core backend concepts using **Django**, including project structure, apps, models, views, URLs, and basic API design.

This repository also serves as preparation for my backend capstone project.

 Objectives
- Learn the structure of a Django project
- Understand how models, views, and URLs work together
- Practice building backend logic using Django
- Gain experience with Git and GitHub version control
- Prepare for building a full backend capstone project

Technologies Used
- Python
- Django
- SQLite(default Django database)
- Git & GitHub

Project Structure
The project follows Django’s standard structure, including:
- Django project configuration
- Django apps
- Models for database interaction
- Views and URL routing
- Basic backend logic and testing

 Challenges Faced
- Understanding Django’s MVC (Model–View–Template) pattern
- Knowing where to place logic within the project structure
- Managing time while learning new backend concepts

These challenges were handled by reviewing documentation, practicing small examples, and breaking tasks into manageable steps.

 Future Improvements
- Implement RESTful APIs using Django Rest Framework
- Add authentication and authorization
- Improve database relationships
- Deploy the backend application
- Integrate with a frontend client
